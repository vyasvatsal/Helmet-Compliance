## ü™ñ Helmet Compliance Detection üö®  
Keeping heads safe, one pixel at a time!

This project uses the power of YOLO object detection and a Raspberry Pi 4B to make sure workers are actually wearing helmets ‚Äî not just claiming to. Snapshots are taken every 10 seconds, and violators are caught red-headed (well, helmet-less).

**üîç No Helmet? Sirens wail.**  
**üì∏ Caught in 4K? Image saved with timestamp.**  
**‚úÖ Wearing one? You‚Äôre good to go.**

### üõ† Tech Stack
- Raspberry Pi 4B ü•ß  
- Python 3.11 üêç  
- ONNX Runtime üß†  
- OpenCV üé•  
- YOLOv5 (Exported to ONNX) üöÄ  

### ‚ú® Features
- ‚úÖ Real-time helmet detection from webcam
- üïí Captures frame every 10 seconds
- üö® Plays alarm if non-compliance is detected
- üì∏ Saves violation snapshot with timestamp
- üíæ Lightweight and Raspberry Pi-ready

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No safety inspector was harmed during the making of this project.
